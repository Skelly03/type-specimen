        <h1>GARAMOND</h1>
       
        <p>EB Garamond is a recreation of Garamond. <b>Garamond is a group of many serif typefaces</b>, named for
            sixteenth-century Parisian engraver Claude Garamond, generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime.
            Garamond-style typefaces are <b>popular and particularly often used for book printing and body text</b>.
            Some distinctive characteristics in Garamond's letterforms are an <b>'e' with a small eye</b> and <b>the bowl of
            the 'a' which has a sharp turn at top left</b>. Other general features are limited but <b>clear stroke contrast
            and capital letters on the model of Roman square capitals</b>. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outwardfacing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the
            letter. <b>The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low</b>, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals
            large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward
            slope and ride above the cap height.</p>

        <h3>Letterforms</h3>
        <p>Letterforms are the building blocks of written communication, each carrying its unique personality
            and visual weight. The design of letterforms can vary dramatically, influencing not only readability but
            also the overall aesthetic of printed material. When considering typography, the choice between serif
            and sans-serif can evoke different emotions; serif fonts, with their classic, ornamental tails, often convey
            a sense of tradition and reliability. This is why they are frequently used in printed works like books and
            newspapers, where legibility and a touch of elegance are paramount.</p>
            
         </section>
    <section class="printing">
        <h3>Printing</h3>
        <p>Printing technology has transformed the way we interact with letterforms, evolving from manual
            typesetting to sophisticated digital processes. Each advancement has allowed for greater precision in
            reproducing serif fonts, ensuring that every curve and angle is rendered beautifully on paper. The
            tactile quality of paper adds another dimension to the experience; its texture and weight can enhance
            the visual appeal of the printed letterforms, making each page feel distinct. The choice of paper can
            dramatically affect how serif fonts appear, with glossy finishes amplifying sharp edges while matte
            surfaces soften them.</p>
            
        </section>
    
    <section class="paper">
        <h3>Paper</h3>
        <p>In the realm of graphic design, the interplay between letterforms, printing techniques, and paper
            selection is crucial. Designers must consider how the characteristics of serif fonts will complement the
            overall project, taking into account the intended audience and the message being conveyed. A wellexecuted print piece, rich in thoughtfully chosen letterforms, can capture attention and leave a lasting
            impression, demonstrating the enduring power of printed text in a digital age.</p> 
        </section>    
    
    <section class="combined">  
            <h3>Combined...</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, the harmony between letterforms, printing methods, and paper types creates a tangible
            connection between the reader and the written word. Each element plays a vital role in crafting a
            cohesive visual language, inviting readers to engage not just with the content but with the artistry of
            typography itself. As we continue to explore the potential of printing, the legacy of letterforms
            especially those elegant serifs remains a testament to the beauty of written communication. </p>
